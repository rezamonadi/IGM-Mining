## ✅ Coding Best Practices Checklist

> Use this checklist to ensure high-quality, maintainable, and collaborative code.

### 🧠 Code Clarity
- [ ] Use descriptive and consistent variable/function names
- [ ] Write modular functions that do one thing well
- [ ] Maintain consistent indentation and formatting
- [ ] Write comments that explain **why**, not just **what**
- [ ] Remove dead or commented-out code before committing

### 🧪 Testing & Validation
- [ ] Write unit tests for each core function or module
- [ ] Include edge-case tests (e.g., empty input, max input size)
- [ ] Use `assert` or equivalent to check critical assumptions
- [ ] Run all tests before committing

### 📚 Documentation
- [ ] Include clear docstrings/comments for every function (inputs, outputs, purpose)
- [ ] Update README with setup, usage, and examples
- [ ] Document important algorithms or decisions in `/docs/`

### ♻️ Reusability & Maintainability
- [ ] Avoid hardcoded values—use named constants or parameters
- [ ] Avoid code duplication—reuse functions when possible
- [ ] Handle exceptions or errors gracefully

### 🧰 Version Control
- [ ] Write meaningful commit messages (e.g., “Fix CIV wavelength filter edge case”)
- [ ] Commit changes in logical, small chunks
- [ ] Use feature branches for new work or experiments

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Collaboration
- [ ] Open issues for bugs or improvements
- [ ] Review code before merging
- [ ] Tag TODOs/FIXMEs clearly in code with comments
